<p>We believe that everyone should be able to engage with their cultural heritage online, and we are not alone in this - libraries, archives and museums around the world are also looking for ways to improve access to and reuse of their digital collections.</p>

<p>We want to help cultural heritage institutions work towards this vision by making it easier for users to understand what they can do with a digital object they discover.  Our work is driven by the absence of a global approach to addressing this.  No other systems meet the specific needs of a broad range of cultural heritage organisations, which has led to a proliferation of terms. This has led to confusion for the organisations and the users.</p>

<h2 id="providing-standardised-interoperable-rights-and-reuse-information">Providing standardised interoperable rights and reuse information</h2>

<p>We provide simple and standardized terms - which we call ‘rights statements’  to summarize the copyright status of objects in their collection, as well as how those objects may be used.</p>

<p>The rights statements are designed to be used by cultural heritage institutions to communicate the copyright and re-use status of digital objects to their users. These statements provide a best practice for use by both  international, national and regional aggregators of cultural heritage data, and the individual institutions and organisations that contribute data to them.</p>

<p>The rights statements are not just about the making things easier for the user.  RightsStatements.org establishes the vocabulary that every organization can use to talk to their audiences - internally and externally - about copyright and related rights in a meaningful way. It provides the technical and governance infrastructure to support their development and adoption, and ensure their on­going relevance.</p>

<h2 id="a-collaborative-approach-to-governance-which-ensures-the-consortium-meet-the-needs-of-the-cultural-heritage-sector">A collaborative approach to governance which ensures the consortium meet the needs of the cultural heritage sector</h2>

<p>The rightsstatements.org consortium is a member based organisation - currently comprising of 5 continental and international aggregators.  Each members contributes an annual fee, and provides in-kind support.</p>

<p>The development of the consortium is overseen by a Steering Committee.  The development and maintenance of the statements are driven by two working groups:  The Statements Working Group, and the Technical Working Group.  All of this is supported by a dedicated coordinator (0.2 FTE) paid for by the consortium.</p>

<p>The Steering Committee made up of 9 representatives of the members, and includes the co-chairs of the working groups.  Seats on the Committee, including the chair and vice chair, are fixed for two years, renewable consecutively once.  The Committee meets bi-monthly, and holds one in-person meeting annually.</p>

<p>The first annual meeting of the Steering Committee was held in September 2017, at the offices of Europeana Foundation, The Hague, Netherlands. The minutes of that meeting are publicly <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FHgxm9YF4ZWBtcDRjfBvcm8SG984cS1bVhPLpmTXQ28/">available here</a>. Minutes of subsequent meetings will be published in due course.</p>

<p>Chair: Paul Keller, independent policy advisor on behalf of Europeana Foundation</p>

<p>Vice Chair: Caitlin Horrall, Library &amp; Archives Canada</p>
